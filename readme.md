# Predictive Cal

## Overview
Predictive Cal is a collection of machine learning models that can be used to predict various outcomes. The project is built using Python and Streamlit, and it allows users to interact with the models through a web interface. The goal of the project is to provide a simple and intuitive way to link forms to machine learning models, enabling users to create a prediction calculator for their specific use case.

## Current Status
The project is under development, with several ML models already implemented for various prediction tasks. The current setup allows for easy configuration and scaling of models using JSON files, which map model parameters, inputs, and features. This structure ensures that new models can be added or updated with minimal changes to the codebase.

The system has been tested locally, and Iâ€™m working on improving the integration and deployment process to ensure a smooth transition from local development to production-ready applications.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone / fork the repository
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application using `streamlit run app.py`
